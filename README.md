# hello-world

I recently obtained my PhD in Economics from Essex and will soon start a PostDoc position. I have started learning Julia and the tutorial I use comes with an introduction to GitHub. I still don't understand exactly how GitHub could be useful in my work but it seems it could be. Now I am just learning to use the environment.
